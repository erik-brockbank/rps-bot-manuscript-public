CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims
of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes.

In order to achieve that purpose, the owner of a Work may voluntarily elect to
apply CC0 to a Work and thereby publicly distribute the Work under its terms,
with knowledge of the Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning
and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights.

A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or
neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").

2. Waiver.

To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, the owner of a Work hereby
overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,
and surrenders all of the owner's Copyright and Related Rights and associated
claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown, in the Work.

3. Public License Fallback.

Should any part of the Waiver be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted,
and the owner hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise the owner's Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work for any purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

No trademark or patent rights held by the owner are waived. The Work is provided
"as is", without warranties of any kind.
